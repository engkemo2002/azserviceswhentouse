# When to Use What Azure Services
<B>When to Use What Azure Services</B>

During my discussions with customers and partners, I have been asked many a times to provide better guidance on When to Use - What Azure Services.

While most of this information is publicly available, it is spread across the huge documentation and difficult to track.

In the attached deck, I intend to provide guidance on when to use what products/services/technologies in Azure through the publicly available content with some customization. Feel free to reuse, distribute and add updates to the content. The areas covered are only Compute, Storage, Networking, Identity, and Database.

I have plans to update on a quarterly basis. However, would require the help of the community to keep this updated, if you find this useful enough :-)
