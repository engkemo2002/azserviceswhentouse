During my discussions with customers and partners, I have been asked many a times to provide better guidance on “When to Use - What Azure Services”. 

While most of this information is publicly available, it is spread across the Azure documentation and could be difficult to find. 

The content in the deck will help sales, pre-sales and technical teams to quickly understand and position right Azure offering/solution to customers. (Compute, network, storage, migration tooling and data platform).

In this deck, I provided guidance on when to use what products/services/technologies in Azure through the publicly available content with some customization. The areas covered are only Compute, Storage, Networking, Identity, and Database.

The deck is available at my GitHub repository under MIT license. Feel free to reuse, distribute and add updates to the content. 

I have plans to update on a quarterly basis. However, would require the help of the community to keep this updated, if you find this useful enough :-)
