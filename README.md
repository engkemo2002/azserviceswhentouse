# When to Use What Azure Services
<B>When to Use What Azure Services</B>

During my discussions with customers and partners, I frequently get asked on specific guidance on when to use specific Azure services. While most of this information is publicly available, it is scattered and difficult to track.

In the attached deck I have tried to provide guidance on when to use what products/services/technologies in Azure through the publicly available content and decision tree charts. Feel free to reuse, distribute and add updates to the content. The areas covered are only Compute, Storage, Networking, Identity, and Database.

I intend to update on a quarterly basis. However, would require the help of the community to keep this updated, if you find this useful enough :-)
